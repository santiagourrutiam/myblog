It's been a weird period of time, not comfortable for many people.... 

This pandemic has rise uncertainty to unprecedent levels and it's consequences to our everyday routines have affected the economy, families our personal relationships and the way we see the world where we live in.

:joy: But we all have to agree that it's been a unique oportunity to slow down, think about our life goals and analize if we should carry on with an unnatural behavior to the earth.

I really hope to continue on my path of learning, sharing moments with new people and never stop against this problems that we face as a society. As long as I can see the cup half-full I will be grateful for the blessing of breathing and being able to see nature everyday.

This blog has been a goal for a long time, I needed a place to store beautiful memories, photos, videos, routes, mountain adventures and other stuff that just manifest out of motivation and good vibes. 

I hope you enjoy the content, stories and tutorials that you can find in my digital journal. Don't hesitate to drop me a line for any reason to santiago.urrutia.m@gmail.com

With much love, 
Chago
