### Intro
You heard about Covid? yeah Covid19!
It's been a weird period of time, not comfortable for many people. Some adapt others keep up, some people suffer, some people see the way to earn money, some help the community, some believe in conspiracy theories, some remember the past to predict our future, some forgot that we are also on a climate change warning and list goes on... 
This pandemic has risen uncertainty to unprecedent levels and it's consequences to our everyday routine have affected the economy, families our personal relationships and the way we see the world where we live in. 

#### Is not **ALL** that bad.
In the other side of the spectrum, we could agree that Covid-19 has been a trigger to all human beings on earth to stop for a minute, for one minute! to slow that crazy routine down, think about our life goals and analize how we can change the way we live to treat our planet in they way it deserves. 

### The Observer
Covid-19 found me totally unaware of the scope that a situation like this would have over the world. Trusting that everything would be alright and that the famous _Wuhan Virus_ would stay in.... well, _"Wuhan"_,China, I decided to board that plane from Santiago and fly to Canada, setting foot on Calgary on March 10th in the morning.  
Adventure was just beginning when days later Chile and Canada announced on consecutives days the desition of closing borders until further notice.

I really hope to continue on my path of learning, sharing moments with new people, keep learning how to live sustainabily and never stop finding solutions and creating dialogue among our peers about the problems that we face as a society. As long as I can see the cup half-full I will be grateful for the blessing of breathing and being able to be in the mountains.

This blog has been a goal for a long time, I needed a place to store beautiful memories, photos, videos, routes, mountain adventures and other stuff that just manifest out of my motivation and personal way to express what I believe life is about. 

To you, fellow human being (for you too extraterrestrial beings that might come check the earth out in a few millions years and found an underground datacenter with datacollections of the old dusty internet that we now navigate), I hope you enjoy the content, stories and tutorials that you can find in my digital journal. 

Don't hesitate to drop me a line if you have any feedback or thoughts.
