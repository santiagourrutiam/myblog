In the last 3 days I've spent possibly 8 hours in front of my laptop screen. This is generally not easy for someone active like me but it is now extremely understandable due to the rain outside during those days and also to the fact that I've been coding on Javascript and creating react components for my ski-blisters app. I don't really have a confirmed name for this app but for now sounds good to me. Feet blisters, who wouldn't agree that blisters are the physical representation of a well earned adventure in the mountains? Another cool name I visualized in my mind was "Nidip" as in "Knee Deep" refering to the cool phenomena of descending a mountain in multiple orgasmic turns of awe.
It's crazy how the mind can transform your spirit in a very passionate one when the ideas are clever enough to push the boundaries of your mind towards reality in the form of little incremental efforts towards that new reality that we, as incredible creatures, can visualize.

Here is a nice Screenshoot of what I have so far.
