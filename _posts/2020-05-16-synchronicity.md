## The melody of this chapter.

It's saturday night, past midnight, had a blast of Friday biking with Meghan and jumping into the cold waters of the Stawamus river followed by a rock throwing session with Connor and Kassie. Overnighted in Squamish, hackaton until 4AM felt unique! and tim Horton's coffee this morning were a good start off to the day. Now back in Whistler I can say that my neck hurts but it doesn't really matter because my mind has experienced the accomplishment of 20 hours into wordpress, coding, raspberri pi and all techie stuff.
Connor and Cam's new company: _*CompuCare*_ will conquer the world!
In the meantime, Tame Impala is feeding my ears with the psychodelic pop that I always enjoy so much. 
I simply love this live version.

Why is this post called synchronicity?
Because it's been a long time since the last time I felt synchronicity at this level. These events are coming up as proportionally as the emotional pulling of taking the easy decision of returning to Chile but staying and giving it a shot feels good. So far it looks like I will have summer and lots of mountain biking ahead :/
