The plans for going further south down the costal mountains were quite easy to develop during the previous days. Martin - Seba's roomate, my new Estonian biking partner and friend - had to pick-up his new passport at Horseshow Bay downtown (102kms away). We had to be there at 16:00 so right before 14:30 we were rolling to the South West on Seba's VolsWagen from Whistler.

Horseshoe Bay was beautiful that afternoon, one of the first encounters with was going to be the summer weather. In the photo you can see the BC ferry in charge of the route Horseshow Bay - Nanaimo.

Photo taken approaching Squamish from the south, we can see _The Chief_, a beautiful granite wall that has 700meters of altitude. One the biggest monolyths of the world.

**The vehicle was going a bit heavier than usual as we were carrying our bikes and they were destined to be ridden in Squamish after accomplishing the first mission: Passport pick-up.**

That's a happy face going uphill on a sunny day.

Back at the car ready to change all the wet and full of mud clothes. Time to curse at the mosquitos and hydrate before going for groceries (it's cheaper in Squamish than Whistler) and go back to Whistler.

Photo from one of the viewpoints enroute to Whistler. A very gentile sunset, a rapid evolution of colors.
