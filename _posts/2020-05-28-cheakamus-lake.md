It's been almost a week taking it easy with my body, specially my wrist movements. After the crash of last week - yes, I had a fall - I felt that I could come back easily in 2 or 3 days but the way I bent my thumb in a funky motion towards my wrist damaged the joint and it wasn't until a week after that I started gaining my confidence back. 
Eventually, rest did his part and I felt ready to go for an easy but long trail with no jumps and big roots on the climb, berms or anything to expose my current injury, _"Cheakamus Lake"_.

The desition to go to Cheakamus Lake was mainly due to my injury and Martin's wishes as he didn't make it to the lake the last time he hiked in the area. 
The headtrail begins south of Whistler and is approx. 11kms and mostly uphill.
