My name is Santiago Urrutia, my friends call me _*Chago*_, I'm a computeer engineer with a strong mix of skills oriented to the tourism industry.
I work in a remote camp in Antarctica during the months of November - January. After that I usually chase winter before returning to Malalcahuello, Chile for the months of June - September. These are the months of winter, when _*The Andes*_ and the southern volcanos are covered with snow.

Hobbies
- I rock an Epiphone SG guitar and my favorite musical band of all times are the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
- I live for skiing in new places.
- My favorite personal challengue is learning new programming languages and opensource libraries.
